# apartment-hunt

A dumb script to help my little brother get email alerts for new apartments in the Netherlands. Since I love him so much, I made an annyoing Shell script to help him setup his environment.

Please don't crtic me on the coding coventions used in this script. It's bad. It's very bad.
